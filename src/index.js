//!--------------------------------- Note on this project -------------------------------
/*
 * This project employees 1 of the 3 method of creating GraphQL APIs
 * i.e It directly uses DB in resolvers (n not the legacy APIs) with the help of Prisma (advanced ORM)
 */

//!------------------------------------ Note on GraphQL ---------------------------------
/* There are 3 root types: Query, Mutation, and Subscription
    >> The fields on these root types are called root fields and define the available API operations.
    >>  When sending operations (such as queries, mutations or subscriptions) to a GraphQL API, these always need to start with a root types

  Other custom types can be also defined in schema but can't be used directly by clients
*/
//! Subscriptions are typically implemented via WebSockets

//!--------------------------------- Note on Apollo-Server ------------------------------
// apollo-server is a fully-featured GraphQL server. It uses Express.js and a few other libraries (behind the scenes) to help build production-ready GraphQL servers.
/*
 * List of its features:
 *      1. GraphQL spec-compliant
 *      2. Realtime functionality with GraphQL subscriptions
 *      3. Out-of-the-box support for GraphQL Playground
 *      4. Extensible via Express middlewares
 *      5. Resolves custom directives in your GraphQL schema
 *      6. Query performance tracing
 *      7. Runs everywhere: Can be deployed via Vercel, Up, AWS Lambda, Heroku etc.
 */
//! apollo-server uses apollo-server-express under the hood.
//! apollo-server v3 doesn't support subscriptions so swap out to apollo-server-express.
// The PubSub class is not recommended for production environments, because it's an in-memory event system that only supports a single server instance.
//* So check out: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/data/subscriptions/#production-pubsub-libraries

//!---------------------------------- Note on Prisma ------------------------------------
// Prisma is an open source database toolkit that makes it easy for developers to reason about their data and how they access it, by providing a clean and type-safe API for submitting database queries.
/*
 * It mainly consists of three tools:
 *      1. Prisma Client: An auto-generated and type-safe query builder for Node.js & TypeScript.
 *      2. Prisma Migrate (experimental): A declarative data modeling & migration system.
 *      3. Prisma Studio (experimental): A GUI to view and edit data in your database.
 */

/* Dev Process
 *  0. If starting with prisma >_ npx prisma init
 *  1. Add the schema in prisma/schema.prisma || if db already exists then pull the schema >_ npx prisma db pull
 *  2. (if schema is updated locally then) To migrate the changes >_ npx prisma migrate dev --name "<comment-similar-to-git>"
 *  3. Now generate client >_ npx prisma generate
 *
 *  * Browse your data with Prisma Studio >_ npx prisma studio
